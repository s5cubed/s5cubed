# What's up?
Welcome to my GitHub profile. If you're wondering who I am, trust me I don't know either, not one label can truly describe me.
Perhaps I'm a lot more like an opportunist. The projects I maintain are not representative of who I am as a person.

## Projects
- https://averi.foo is a SFW only imageboard for discussing anthropomorphic animals, and shitposting.
- Schlog+ (Retired) was a browser extension for a Xenforo Forum that I used to use.

# Fix it now, or you go to jail.
What is a database? **AUGH! It already has users?!?** Redis? MongoDB?
